[Setting up a server]
----------------------
The project is currently not in a state of allowing our members to setup their own servers. For more information on how to become a partner with us and receive beta versions of the gamemode, please contact Jack over on GTANet (in #GTA-Life).

Usage / Terms of Agreement
--------------------------
> The branding of the framework is to remain as "GTA Life". This means you cannot modify the framework name to something else. i.e: GTA-Life by YOURCOMMUNITYNAME/TAG. Everything about naming / branding is to be left untouched.

> All of the code in the framework isto not be used outside of the resource in other projects.
> Core configurations, such as: MySQL, Income, Starting cash, ... is allowed to be modified.
> The framework comes with an API built into the gamemode to offer server owners to extend the gamemode to their desire. The features they create using the API is credited to them and not part of GTA-Life.
> The framework is not to be used commercially and is to remain freeware. This includes requiring donations / payments to be able to play in your server with our framework. Restricting elements of the framework to donators only is also a no no.
